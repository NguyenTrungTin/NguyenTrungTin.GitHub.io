## About me
#### Born
*The first time I cry in my life is 3h40 AM, 01/06/1994. I don't know how it is but I always think that it's a beautiful day! Yes, I'm a Gemini. I'm summer boy!*
#### Young
*I'm a giddy boy, a naughty student and.... Sometimes I'm a romantic, sometimes not. I entered Ho Chi Minh city University of Law in the fall of 2012.*
#### Now
*I love code. I teach myself to learn Information Technology. Creativity is the biggest reason that I love it. I belong it...*
#### Next
*Shhh! It's secret. Time will let you know!*
#### Future
*I don't believe in the saying: "What will be will be." I'll creat my future for myself!*
## Love
##### Smoking
##### Coffee
##### Music
##### Code
## Dream
#### I have a... dream!
######  *When I was a child, when I was a boy and until now... The first day or the last day of my life. Forever!*
#### Fly over sky. Look stars. Walk on the Mars...
#### And sleep on the Space!
## Think
*Freedom like an eagle, Fighting like a lion and Power like a king!*

*Never use your life to follow the thoughts of others. Listen to your heart. Do what you want. That is the true happiness!*

*I don't need to apologize for who I am and what I want.*

*Dream it. Do it. Make it come to life!*
## Work
Coming soon!
